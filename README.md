# Stocks Server Application

## Description
I wrote and deployed an Express application that replicated the services provided by the Swagger API supplied in assignment 1. The API matched the 3 GET routes, one of which was authorized, and 2 POST routes, allowing the user to login and register. This API was then converted to server on HTTPS, via a self-signed certificate, followed by being deployed. A wide variety of secure middleware were used in this API, to produce an overall secure, clean API.

## Requirements
- .env file with DB_USER, DB_PASS and KEY
- MySQL
